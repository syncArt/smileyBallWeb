The digital marketplace and in particular the NFT marketplace is flooded with images. We can probably find an NFT Marketplace on every network offering to sell unique images. Everyone is trying to differentiate themselves with the uniqueness of their approach to digital art using increasingly sophisticated AI tools. Pixelmojis assume that digital art can be extended to include an additional form such as emoji-art. Cryptopunks were the forerunner of pixel art and we want to continue and extend this trend. Pixelmojis want to present a new approach to creating pixel art, where each pixel can also carry a corresponding emotion. We can thus generate images that we emotionally characterise through emojis. But emoticons are not just about playing with images....
Another value we want to bring out of emoji is the possibility of identification by assigning ourselves emoji with which we want to identify. This allows you to present your persona to the public in a simple and illustrative way so that we immediately know who we are dealing with.

The SmileyBall is a smiling emoticon that represents goodness and value. It cannot be directly attributed to one person but can be used to label something of value. How do you distinguish valuable content from average quality? They can be recognised by creators who specialise in particular fields, so the plan is to build a tool that will give roles in society and through these roles they will be defined as specialists in their fields. This will distinguish them from other people so that they will be able to express themselves on issues that are relevant to them. Let's say person A is a programmer, learned to play instruments as a child and graduated from music school and watches snooker after hours. He will be able to brand his profile where the first emoji will represent his main profession, the second will represent his second profession and the third will signify his hobbies. In this way, the person will represent 3 specialisations and, because of these specialisations, will be able to reward creators by giving away a smileyBall in the comments. The evaluation of who was ultimately right about the quality of the content is left to the discretion of the AI, which will judge the merit to the number of smileyBalls given out for the content creator.

I will now describe how the reward system via smileyBall is supposed to work. People - creators post content on X (used interchangeably with Twitter) and users comment. If someone wants to take part in the competition, they comment @giveSmileyBall on entries that they think are valuable and are in their area of interest. The taggers, as well as the creators of the tagged tweets, are considered for the competition.

## Profession
Each users can mint his SmileyBall NFT with 3 following emojis where each emoji means something else.
People have to mint SmileyBall NFT with a specific set [main, second, hobby].
System defines that main profesion is "SERIOUS", second is "SERIOUS" or "FUN" and hobby is "FUN".

## Giving / Receiving SmileyBall

## Rewarding content creators and users

After a set period of time (let's assume it will be 2 weeks), all the tagged tweets and people who have tagged tweets using @giveSmileyBall are collected, followed by an evaluation through AI tools. Those creators who score the highest number of üôÇ are assured of their allocation in advance. Other creators have to wait for a score from the AI tool. The AI tool for each category will have its parameters by which it will evaluate the content. The final score is a simple numerical score on a scale of 1-10. The person who has won also gets a motivation.
If the content creator has previously created an account in the system with the professions set up, his or her reward is doubled in the event that he or she wins in the category in which he or she specialises (defined by the professions). The same applies to commentators for set professions.
The prize giving takes place inside the system where users log in using their Twitter profiles.
